## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer) installed on your computer.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/lilbalageru/Smart-Fridge-Culinar
    cd smart-fridge-assistant
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up your Environment Variables:**
    This project requires a Google Gemini API key.

    * Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project.
    * Add your API key to this file:
        ```
        GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
        ```
    * You can get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your application should now be running at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port).
